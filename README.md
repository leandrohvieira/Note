# Note

This projetc looks at how to develop and test an asynchronous API with FastAPI, Postgres,
pytest and Docker using Test-driven Development (TDD). We'll also use the Databases package 
for interacting with Postgres asynchronously.

### Dependencies:

1. FastAPI v0.88.0
2. Docker v20.10.21
3. Python v3.11.0
4. pytest v7.2.0
5. Databases v0.6.2


### Objectives:


1. Develop an asynchronous RESTful API with Python and FastAPI
2. Practice Test-driven Development
3. Test a FastAPI app with pytest
4. Interact with a Postgres database asynchronously
5. Containerize FastAPI and Postgres inside a Docker container
6. Parameterize test functions and mock functionality in tests with pytest
7. Document a RESTful API with Swagger/OpenAPI
